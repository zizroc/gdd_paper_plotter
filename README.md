The Range Creek radiocarbon dates come from:
Reference: Boomgarden, S. A., Metcalfe, D., & Springer, C. (2014). Prehistoric archaeology in range Creek canyon, Utah: a summary of the activities of the range Creek field station. Utah Archaeology, 27(1), 9-32.

You will need to download the CARD data from: https://www.canadianarchaeology.ca/ (which requires registration)
Reference: Martindale, Andrew, Richard Morlan, Matthew Betts, Michael Blake, Konrad Gajewski, Michelle Chaput, Andrew Mason, and Pierre Vermeersch (2016) Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD 2.1), accessed January 10, 2020.

Edit: The CARD data have been slightly updated with the addition of several more sites that were previously mislabelled in CARD. Lists of the sites have also been added to this repository.

The PRISM DEM data comes from: http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/
Refrence: PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, http://prism.oregonstate.edu, created 15 Jan 2020

The climate data (tmin and tmax, and precipitation) are enormous. I aim to process them into much smaller files and link to here; in the meantime, contact me for data if desired: zizroc@nceas.ucsb.edu
